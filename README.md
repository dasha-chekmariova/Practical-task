# Cinema-Trustee
## This is practical task

In this React single app page prescribed service that helps to choose a movie session that coincides in time with the user's free hour.
The point is that this service accepts two arrays of data. The first one stores the current user's schedule, and the second one stores the list of movies that are currently in cinema.

You can open this project local in your PC:
 * clone my repo use terminal
 * npm start

Also I have deployed this page:
